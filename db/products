1	Goshen White	Trebbiano grape with good acid balance and a floral bouquet.	10.00
4	Moscato Sweet	Has the smell of orange peels and the taste of over ripe melons.	15.00
3	Blueberry	Our bluebery wine is made from fresh fruit grown in Hammonton, NJ. The wine is clear and brite, and the sweetness is balanced with fresh acids.	15.00
5	Court House Blush	Our Trebbiano grape tinted with Merlot and slightly sweetened in a fruity sangria style wine.\n	13.00
6	Chardonnay	Clean and brite with the crisp citrus flavors of lemons and lime. Try it with broiled or baked fish.\n	12.00
7	Pinot Grigio	This wine is light and delicate yet contains bold acids like a green apple.\nDelicious with chicken and other fowl dishes.\n\n	12.00
8	Sauvignon Blanc	Light golden color with the smell of freshly cut summer grass. A refreshing drink at day's end. Goes great with shell fish.	12.00
9	Meadow's Edge	Made from very ripe California grapes (like Grandpop used to get) but blended with our Cape May Tempranillo grape. This is a hot wine with a surprisingly smooth finish.	15.00
10	Cedar Hammock	Blend of our Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes and aged at least two years in oak barrels. Loads of jammy fruit and enough tannins to make your mouth pucker. Try it with prime ribs.	15.00
11	Merlot	This variety grows best in our sany soils and maritime climate. The nose of this wine makes you think of raspberries and strawberries. The acids are crisp and leave a long finish in your mouth. 	15.00
12	Cabernet Sauvignon	Our most vigorous variety with large cordons, thick shoots and uniform clusters of loose berries that ripen in late October. The wine is youthful yet the nose takes in black ripe currants while the mouth tastes soft silky tannins.	15.00
