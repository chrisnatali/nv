NOTE:  These are probably incomplete and not sufficiently tested

Tools required:
SVN
MySQL
Ruby and Rails
Mongrel

Assumes these are all installed, and that a mysql server is running.

To get the source, develop and run, do the following:
1.  Get the source from svn repository by doing:
    svn co svn+ssh://user@72.249.22.57/home/svn/sites/nv/trunk

(The rest assumes you are 'in' the trunk directory)

2.  Create the MySQL dev database by running the db/create-db.dev.sql
    script.  Then run the db/create.sql script to create the tables.

3.  Start the server via:
    [sudo] mongrel_rails start [-C config/mongrel.yml]

4.  Test the site via browser.  The full url for the site running
on a localhost should be something like http://localhost:3000/main
depending on configuration (can be defined in config/mongrel.yml)
